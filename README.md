# CustomAdvTshirt

We propose a method to create customized adversarial T-shirts that protects a person from being detected by a visual object detection model. It is customized in two ways: the adversarial noise is trained over customized data and the shape of the adversarial noise is restricted by a customized stencil. Our method is able to fool the YOLOv5 model with a T-shirt patched with customized adversarial noise carved by a Cornell bear stencil.
